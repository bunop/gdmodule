gd module install notes

I'm going to assume that you've got the GD library (version 2.0.8 or
higher) installed, which is pretty trivial to do. If you're having
troubles with that, I suggest you have a look at that package's
instructions.

This version of gdmodule is written assuming you have PNG, JPEG, FreeType,
and Xpm libraries incorporated into your copy of GD. If you have an
incomplete version you will have difficulty getting this one to build.

Starting with gdmodule 0.30 the installation is done via the standard
Distutils.  Do this (as root if necessary):

    python setup.py install

This should build the _gd.so extension and install it along with the gd.py
module in the standard location on your system.

As of right now, I don't have a build for Windows.  If I get time I might
put one together.
